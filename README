README for the OpenClass style package

The style package for OpenClass includes the styles necessary to
style the OpenClass project to a base look and feel.

To call the styles in your development environment and simulate the 
overrides that occur in production you can call the following 
files in the following order:

openclass.css (dojo widget theme)
appStyles.css (style the application itself)
OC_overrides.css (style overrides per institution)

This implementation is dependant on the presence of dojo.css.
Dojo.css provides it's own reset and rebuild of styles.

Final production files will be compressed and minified to reduce
http calls.
