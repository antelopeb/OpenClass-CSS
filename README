 README for the OpenClass style package

The style package for OpenClass includes the styles necessary to
style the OpenClass project to a base look and feel.

To call the styles in your development environment and simulate the 
overrides that occur in production you can call the following 
files in the following order:

openclass.css (dojo widget theme)
appStyles:
	admin.css (for Whittaker)
	digitalVellum.css (for Digital Vellum)
	personalHome.css (for Personal Home)
	share.css (for share)
OC_overrides.css (style overrides per institution)

This implementation is dependant on the presence of dojo.css.
Dojo.css provides it's own reset and rebuild of styles.

Final production files will be compressed and minified to reduce
http calls.

Making changes:
If you need to make modifications to the files, you have to follow these restrictions.

Images - If you need to add images, make sure they are in an images folder relative to the css and copy them into the root image folder of your called css file.

Example - you add a sprite to the app-override.css file in admin. You place the image file in _trunk/appStyles/toolbar/admin/images and then place a copy of the image into _trunk/appStyles/images so that when the file is compressed, it still calls from the correct location. This is because you will pull the app-override.css in through _trunk/appStyles/admin.css in production.
